# Slide Design by AI? Exploring the Use of LLMs for Business Presentations

My project explores the feasibility of using AI to create business presentations, and what the implications of doing so would be. After exploring ChatGPT's understanding of corporate communications best practices and to what extent it is aware of the audience of presentations, I employ an AI slide generation tool called Gamma to make a presentation about the top 5 features of ChatGPT-4o. While Gamma was able to output polished looking slides, the information in the slides was sometimes drawn from outside of the prompt, and Gamma struggled to create images for the presentation with legible text. I conclude that tools such as Gamma could assist humans in slide creation, but they are not yet sophisticated enough to replace the thoughtful, deliberate presentation planning process that is key to a successful presentation.
